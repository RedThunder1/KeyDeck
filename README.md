# # KeyDeck
This is another little project of mine where I'm trying to make my own stream deck thing with an arduino and a java app, which will be here.
If this project ends up actually working well I might make documentation on how to make this.

# Info
This project will probably take a while to make since I just started messing around with swing, so I have a lot I need to figure out.  Serial communication between the PC and Arduino has also proved to be a bit difficult.
